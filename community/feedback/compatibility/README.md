# Website Compatibility Feedback

Help us ensure HiWave works with every website!

## Quick Report

Found a website that doesn't work correctly? [Report it here](https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/community/issues/new?template=compatibility-report.yml).

## What We Track

We maintain a database of website compatibility:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Works** | Site renders and functions correctly |
| **Minor Issues** | Small visual differences, fully usable |
| **Major Issues** | Significant problems, partially usable |
| **Broken** | Site doesn't work at all |
| **Not Tested** | No reports yet |

## High-Priority Sites

We prioritize fixes for:

1. **Top 1000 sites** by traffic (Tranco list)
2. **Sites with multiple reports**
3. **Completely broken sites** (vs minor differences)
4. **Essential services** (banking, email, productivity)

## Before Reporting

1. **Try the latest version** - Update HiWave first
2. **Disable extensions** - Test with extensions disabled
3. **Clear cache** - Try clearing site data
4. **Check existing reports** - Search for the site first

## What Makes a Good Report

- **Specific URL** - The exact page with issues, not just the domain
- **Screenshots** - Both HiWave and Chrome, same viewport
- **Description** - What specifically is different
- **Reproducibility** - Does it happen every time?
