## Open Questions

1. **Incentive structure**: Beyond recognition, should we offer monetary rewards for high-impact contributions?

2. **Governance**: As community grows, how do we handle disagreements about priorities?

3. **Quality vs quantity**: How do we maintain test quality as volume increases?

4. **Cross-platform**: How do we handle Windows-specific vs macOS-specific issues?

5. **Privacy**: What data do we collect from beta testers and how is it protected?
